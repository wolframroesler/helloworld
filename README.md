# Source Code for the Hello World Collection

This is the source code from which the Hello World Collection at http://helloworldcollection.de is built.

Source files for the languages are in `files`. Imgages are in `hellopics`.

The Collection is created with `build.sh`. The script is not universal, you'll have to modify it before it works on your computer.

http://youtu.be/bGGkcCZNHj0 shows how the Collection is built (or rather, how it was built before hosting on Github).
