Thanks a lot (and sorry for the very late reply), I'll include it in the next version of the Collection, which will be online soon after you receive this mail.

Best regards

Thanks, but what is the comment character? I like the programs to start with a comment in the respective language.

That's great, but do you happen to have a Unicode representation?
Like the Greek entry, for instance, which in my HTML source
looks like this:

   <tr><td>Greek</td>
   <td>&#915;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#963;&#959;&#965;&#954;
   &#972;&#963;&#956;&#949;!
   <i>(Geia soy kosme)</i></td>

I'm keeping the list in ASCII files and I'm afraid those special
characters aren't going to survive copy-and-paste into my text
editor.

If you don't, never mind, I'll use a GIF then (like in the Japanese
entry, for instance).




Thanks a lot, but there are enough XML variations in the
Collection already, and these are actually file formats,
not full-featured (Turing-complete) programming languages,
so I decided not to include any more of them in the
Collection.

Thanks anyway

Hello,

is this really a real (Turing-complete) programming language,
or merely a ... without real
programming capabilities (variables, conditionals, loops
etc.)?
In order to keep the Collection from getting bloated, I decided
to limit future entries to real programming languages only.

Thanks and best regards

Hello,

Is this a widely used/known programming language, or simply a private/academic project mostly unknown outside of its creators' community? To keep the Collection from getting bloated I decided to include only languages that have gained some kind of popularity. For example, yours doesn't seem to have a Wikipedia  article on it.

Thanks and best regards
