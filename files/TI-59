Hello World for the TI-59 with PC-100C thermo printer.
No comment character exists.

The TI-59/PC-100C can print up to 20 characters per line (upper case
only). They are coded as 2-digit decimal numbers (see manual for
details) in up to four print registers (of five characters each)
and then printed.
Before entering the program, press LRN to switch into learn mode.
After entering the program, cancel learn mode with LRN, turn on the
printer, and run the program with A.
A pleasant sound, and what a font! Real TRUE-TYPE!

The output looks like this:
